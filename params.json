Given a dictionary of words and a log file of the encrypted passwords with the users, we use Jcrypt to help reverse engineer the encrypted passwords back to plaintext.\r\n\r\n## How was it done?\r\nThis project was done using Sublime Text as our preferred choice of text editor on a Linux machine (gnome). For testing, we just fed in different input files (encryptions and their plain text counter parts) and see how many passwords we crack successfully.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
